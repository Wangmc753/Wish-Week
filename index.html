        <p>Wish Week is approaching, and fast! To recap, this is a week-long event where we partner with Make-A-Wish Colorado and their ‚ÄúKids For Wish Kids‚Äù program to sponsor a child with a life-threatening medical condition. As a school, we hold several events throughout the week in order to raise money to grant our Wish Kid‚Äôs wish as well as many others. </p>
            <hr>
            <b>**This year, Wish Week is: <b> February 7th - February 11th</b>**
            <h2><b>All information for the week can be found in this email! Please read below:</b></h2>
            <ul>
                </p>
                <li>During Wish Week last year, we adopted Rynn into the Mountain Vista family and granted her wish with Spiderman! We granted her wish as well as 25 others! Over the course of 9 years, the Mountain Vista community has granted over 100+ wishes and raised over a million dollars! Resulting in the number one fundraising school in the nation for the past 7 years.</li>
                <li>Wish Week 2022 is also going to be a very special year. This year, our Wish Kid is named Walter and his wish is to have a space experience and go to space camp. Make sure you keep a close eye on February 11th to see an out-of-this-world experience. </li>
                <li>Walter is 9 years old and has Cystic Fibrosis, which is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Walter loves space and spends his time researching planets, stars, and solar systems. He likes to listen to classical music, play chess, and watch Star Wars and Odd Squad in his free time. His favorite color is sky blue and his favorite foods are Raisin Bran Cereal, chocolate ice cream, and french fries.</li>
                <li>We will be partnering with Be A Good Person for the ninth year. Each year they create a custom design for our Wish Kid.</li>

        <h3><b>Online Student Ordering Options</b></h3>
    <h>Students have three options when purchasing their Wish Shirt:</h>

    <ol>
        <li>The first option is a <b>Wish Kit</b> that is all-inclusive (with the exception of the Friday basketball game). In each Wish Kit is a BAGP shirt and wristband. With the wristband, students get into all of the events throughout the week (Unified, Vista Idol, Ruff n‚Äô Tuff, Wrestling, Hockey, and Boys Basketball on Tuesday) for FREE. This is to encourage involvement and participation. Students are encouraged to purchase wristbands as it is the easiest and cheapest way to participate in all Wish Week festivities! Wish Kits are $30 and will get students into every event for the week, except the basketball game on Friday. If you do not have a wristband (adults/spectators included) there is a $5 entry fee to each event. 

</li>
        <li>The second option is to purchase the <b>VIP Wish Kit</b>. This kit will also get students into events for free, with the exception of the basketball game on Friday. The VIP Wish Kit includes the Wish Week shirt, wristband, and BAGP custom sticker, BAGP water bottle, Make A Wish Sticker, Make A Wish Lanyard, and an entry to meet the wish kid. VIP kits are $50 and ONLY AVAILABLE ONLINE FROM NOW THROUGH JANUARY 9TH!!!</li>
